## Full API spec



## Shared Knowledge

'server.js' contains the core server logic shared across various modules like authentication, encryption, speech-to-text, GPT integration, user interface, and feedback system.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how the GPT-4 integration will handle different industry-specific jargon and whether additional training on specific job sectors is required. We may need to consult OpenAI's documentation or seek further clarification from OpenAI regarding the capabilities of GPT-4 in handling specialized terminology.
