Develop a secure and privacy-compliant real-time web application for interview assistance that leverages GPT-4-powered responses, real-time speech-to-text, and incorporates user-provided context (job descriptions, resumes)

## Project Name

interview_assist_app

## Product Goals

- Ensure the application is secure and maintains user privacy
- Provide real-time, accurate, and context-aware assistance for interview preparation
- Deliver a user-friendly interface that enhances the interview learning experience

## User Stories

- As a privacy-conscious individual, I want to ensure my data is handled securely and with confidentiality

## Competitive Analysis

- InterviewGenius: Offers real-time feedback but lacks GPT-4 integration for advanced context understanding
- PrepMyInterview: Utilizes AI for question generation but does not provide speech-to-text features
- MockMate: Has a good database of questions but lacks personalized context incorporation
- InterviewBuddy: Offers live interview practice but lacks real-time AI assistance
- SpeakAI: Provides speech-to-text analysis but not tailored specifically for interview preparation
- HireVue: Focuses on video interviews with AI analysis but not real-time assistance
- Voomer: Offers interview practice but with limited privacy options

## Requirement Analysis

The application requires a secure backend to handle sensitive user data. Real-time speech-to-text functionality is essential for immediate feedback during mock interviews. GPT-4 integration is necessary for generating context-aware questions and responses. The front-end must be intuitive and easy to navigate to ensure a positive user experience.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement secure user authentication and data encryption to protect personal information']
- ['P0', 'Integrate GPT-4 for generating dynamic, context-aware interview content']
- ['P0', 'Develop real-time speech-to-text feature to transcribe user responses']
- ['P1', 'Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive for users of varying technical skills']
- ['P2', 'Incorporate a feedback system that uses AI to give users constructive criticism on their responses']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a clean and modern design with a dashboard for inputting resumes and job descriptions, an interview simulation area with real-time transcription, and a feedback section with AI-generated suggestions for improvement.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how the GPT-4 integration will handle different industry-specific jargon and whether additional training on specific job sectors is required.
